## Background

Renegotiate your utility bills by learning what your neighbors pay.

Everybody on your block probably pays different prices for their internet / TV and phone service. Also, the utility companies have a strong upper hand when talking with you:

* They know how much you pay, and everyone else pays
* They write the legislation that prevents you from starting a competing company
* They make agreements with competing firms to ensure only one or a few companies operate in one zip code
* They advertise one price on TV and then charge a completely different price on the bill

We are a civic project to fix this problem by empowering consumers to make better decisions.

* See what your neighbors pay
* Call your utility company to renegotiate your rate
* Use the money you save to go on vacation
